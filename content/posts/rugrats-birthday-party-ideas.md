Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be an idea, a product, a service, or a process. Inventors are people who create new things. They have inventive minds and are always looking for ways to improve upon what already exists.
The invention process involves four main steps: ideation, development, prototype testing, and commercialization. Ideation is the stage in which an inventor comes up with an idea for a new product or service. Development is the stage in which the inventor turns the idea into a plan and begins to create a prototype. Prototype testing is the stage in which the prototype is put to the test to see if it works as intended. Commercialization is the stage in which the invention is made available to consumers.

Inventions can be either big or small.

Creativity is not a rare talent; it is a skill that can be learned and developed. Just as we exercise our bodies to stay physically fit, we need to exercise our minds to stay mentally fit. A creative person is not necessarily someone who paints or writes poetry; creativity is a way of looking at the world with fresh eyes and seeing possibilities where others see only problems.

What is brainstroming and how does it work?
There is a lot of debate surrounding the term brainstroming. What is it? And how does it work? The answer to both questions is that brainstroming occurs when people are unfocused or processor-locked. This can lead to a lack of focus and an inability to process information. It’s often difficult to know where to turn or what to do next, which can result in a feeling of emptiness or hopelessness.
Brainstroming is typically accompanied by feelings of helplessness and confusion. People may feel like they don’t have any control over their lives and they don’t know what to do next. This can be a difficult time for both the person with brainstroming and those around them. It’s important for those with brainstroming to seek help if they feel lost or hopeless.

Impact of innovation: What are the implications of new technology on society and the economy?
Invention ideas are changing the way we live and work. They can bring new ways of doing things, products or services to market that improve our quality of life or create new economic opportunities. However, as innovation increases, so do the potential implications it has on society and the economy. One key question is how these changes will impact workers, businesses and the public sector. Another is how best to manage and accommodate those changes.
The United Kingdom recently announced a £149 million investment in innovation research and development (IRD). This brings IRD into line with other European countries that have also placed emphasis on innovation as a key part of their growth plans. The UK is seen as an example of how businesses and investors can benefit from early adoption of innovative technologies. It also shows that there is still a great deal of interest in this type of investment in Britain.

Conclusion: What are the implications of innovation for business?
Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.
