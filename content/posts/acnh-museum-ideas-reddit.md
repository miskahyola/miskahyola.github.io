The benefits of innovation
Innovation is key to the future of many businesses and economies. It allows businesses to create new products, services and processes that improve customer experience,cut costs, or create new markets. Innovation also drives down prices for goods and services, making them more affordable for consumers. In the past, innovation was typically a result of technological advances or economicè€… capitalism that allowed businesses to produce new products or services with little interference from government regulations. However, times have changed and now innovation can come from anything - technology, creativity or business acumen. Here are three Case Studies that illustrate why innovation is so important today:
