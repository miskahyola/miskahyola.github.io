Invention: Limitations of invention
Invention limitations are a key concern for the modern age. Invention has played an important role in human society, and this is only expected to continue as technology advances. However, there are some areas where invention can be limited, which can have a significant impact on the economy and society.

It is also important to note that new ideas often come from people who are not experts in their field and must work hard to develop them into a product or service that can be used by others.
