Creative Process: What are some creative ideas?
Creative process starts with brainstorming. A brainstorm is a meeting where people come up with ideas for a project. The purpose of a brainstorm is to get feedback on what ideas are feasible and what don't work. Once you have narrowed down your list, it's time to start the creative process.
One way to start the creative process is by looking at the problem and seeing how you can solve it. Another way to do this is by understanding the problem from different angles. Finally, looking at potential solutions can help you create a better idea.

Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
The Creative Art process begins with the artist’s idea. This idea can be something as simple as a thought or a plan, but it is important that the artist is able to come up with an interesting and unique solution to the problem at hand. After coming up with an interesting solution, the artist continues working on this solution until they have a workflow that they are happy with. The artwork then becomes a product of this unique workflow.

What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everywhere. Whether it’s on a T-shirt, in your head, or on the internet, there are always new and innovative ways to approach problems and solve problems. 
There are many types of ideas, but here are three that stand out the most to me: 
1. The brainstorming method: This is a great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Simply take some time and brainstorm all of the different options until you have a few that you like the best.
2. The problem/solution process: This is another great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Once you have a few good ones, you can start working on solving the real world problems that they address.
