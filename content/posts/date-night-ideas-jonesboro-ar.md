How do we come up with big ideas?
Ideas are a vital part of any business, and when it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First, big ideas should be purposeful and tailored to the needs of your business. You must also have a clear plan for how you will execute on them, as well as the resources necessary to make them a reality. Finally, it’s important to remember that big ideas often require more than one person or even several teams to come up with them. As such, always be prepared to listen and learn from others who may have experience working on large projects.

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.
