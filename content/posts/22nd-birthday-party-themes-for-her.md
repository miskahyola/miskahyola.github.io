Conclusion
After months of toiling away on a project, it can be easy to feel like you've lost your creative edge. Fear not! Here are a few tips to help get your creative juices flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to get out of a rut is to take a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This will help you come back to your project with fresh eyes and new ideas.
2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them.
3. Doodle: Sometimes the quickest way to jump start your creativity is simply to start doodling.

The role of invention in innovation: What benefits can it bring to businesses?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new design, product or service that is different from those currently in use. It can have a number of benefits for businesses, including increasing efficiency and saving time. For example, the discovery of a new vaccine could lead to saved lives and reduced TB cases. There are also plenty of other examples where innovation can have significant impacts on businesses. For example, the development of new transportation methods could lead to increased efficiency in travel or the development of new materials that can improve quality control processes.

Invention is the process of creating something new, whether that be a product or a design.

Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.
