Waste Management: How do you deal with waste when completing a DIY project?
Do you have any extra materials or tools that you don't need and could use on a future project? Do you have old clothes, furniture, or other materials that you don't want to throw away but can't seem to get rid of? If so, there are a few ways to deal with waste when completing a DIY project. 
One way is to bin the material and put it in a landfill. This option is often cheaper and takes less time than dealing with the waste physically. Another option is to recycle the material. This process involves sorting the material by type (paper, plastics, metal) and then putting it into appropriate jars or sacks. The recycling process can take weeks or even months, but it is usually cheaper than trying to get rid of the material physically.

How do we create innovative products?
Innovation is the ability to create new products or services that solve a problem that was not previously considered. For some businesses, innovation can come from coming up with a new way to do something, getting better at what you do, or even creating something entirely new. In other cases, innovation can come from taking an existing product and making it better. Sometimes this is easy- like when a business comes up with a new way to make their product more efficient- and sometimes it takes more effort, like when a company comes up with a revolutionary new technology. Innovation is important because it allows businesses to stay ahead of the curve and give their customers the best possible experience.
