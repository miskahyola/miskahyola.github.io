What are big ideas?
There are many big ideas out there, and it can be tough to decide which ones to pursue. Here are some key tips to help you come up with the best ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. What is your target market? What are your ultimate goals? When it comes to big ideas, these questions will help you determine which ones are the most feasible and actionable.

2. Take a step back and assess the feasibility of your idea. This includes figuring out how much work it will take to make your idea a reality, how much money you’ll need to create a prototype or develop an MVP, and whether or not you have the right team in place to execute on your vision.

3. Get more input from others before finalizing your idea.
