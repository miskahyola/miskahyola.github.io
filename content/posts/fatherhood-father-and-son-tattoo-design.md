Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.

What are some tips for making big ideas a reality?
There are a few things you can do to help turn big ideas into reality. Here are some tips:
1. Make sure your idea is unique and interesting. Don’t just copy other people’s ideas – make sure you have your own approach that will stand out from the rest.

2. Get input from others – get feedback from people who have experience in the industry you’re thinking of entering. This will help you develop your idea further and come up with moreQaeda-friendly ideas.

3. Be persistent – if you don’t keep trying, eventually someone will come up with an idea that is similar to yours but has a bit more money or prestige attached to it. Keep at it, and eventually your idea will be accepted and turned into a reality!
