Definition of innovation: The process of coming up with a new, original idea or product.
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new, original idea or product. Innovation can come in many forms, but it's most commonly used when someone comes up with a new way to do something. Innovation can be seen as the result of ideas and exploration, as well as the courage to take risks. For example, Apple was able to come up with the iPhone thanks to their innovation. In order for innovation to work, there must be a clear vision and an understanding of what people want and need. This requires creativity and risk-taking, both of which are something that often isn't easy to find in most businesses.
