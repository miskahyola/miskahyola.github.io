Invention history is a long and flexible way to describe the process of creating something new. From the early days of mankind, when people were just starting to learn how to make things, Invention has always been an important part of human life. Sometimes, an idea can be very simple, and other times it may be more complex. But in both cases, it can bring about a lot of change and improvement for those who come up with it. Here are some examples of inventions that have made a big difference in the world:
