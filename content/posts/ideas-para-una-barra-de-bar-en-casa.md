Creativity is an unpredictable process that often occurs during the creative process. It can be considered a type of improvisation, which is where ideas and thoughts come together without pre-determined plans or expectations.

Ideation is when something new and unheard of comes to mind, while creation is when it is put into a realistic form through creativity and collaboration.

The five types of ideas: creative,icidal, practical, educational, and entertaining.
Creative ideas can be anything from cleaning up your basement to starting a business. They can be fun and enjoyable, or they can have a serious purpose. Educational ideas are important, especially for younger generations who are just starting out in life. They can help teach them about different topics and how to get things done. Practical ideas are great for people who need to do things quickly or who don't have time to waste. Some examples of practical ideas include becoming a doctor, lawyer, or mechanic. The last type of idea is the most interesting and entertaining, because it can bring people together in a shared interest. For example, if you're an artist, you might want to start a painting blog or create a YouTube channel about your work.
