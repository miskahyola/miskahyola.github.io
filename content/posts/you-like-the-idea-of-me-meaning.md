The history of invention: Discuss the origins of invention and how it has changed over time.
Invention is the process of bringing ideas or objects together in a new way. It is often seen as the first step in creating something new, and it has been an important part of human history since the beginning.
The first inventions were probably simple tools and devices that made everyday tasks easier. Over time, more complex inventions were developed, such as the wheel and the printing press.
