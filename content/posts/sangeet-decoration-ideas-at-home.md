What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

How to get started with big ideas?
If you're looking to start making big ideas, one of the best ways to do it is by learning how to brainstorm. A lot can be gained from practicing brainstorming, especially if you want to come up with ideas for projects or products that are both new and innovative. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 
1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself 
When brainstorming, it's important not to spend too much time just thinking about what other people might think or feel about your idea.

How can you create a compelling value proposition?
Creating a compelling value proposition is a critical part of any business. By understanding and addressing the needs of your target audience, you can create a product or service that offers value to customers. Here are four pieces of advice to help you create a solid value proposition:
1)Clarify what your product or service does that others don't. Define what your customers need and want, and make sure your offer encompasses this. If they don't know what it is, they're likely not going to want it.
2)Know who your target market is. A good way to identify this is by doing market research on yourself or your competition. Understand the unique needs of your target market and craft your value proposition around these goals.
3)Make sure the price is fair.
