Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.

Thesis: There are a lot of new ideas out there, but what are the best ones?
The best new ideas come from a variety of sources, but some of the most promising concepts come from the fields of neuroscience and computer science. These two fields are providing researchers with innovative ways to study the human brain and provide insights into how we process information. In neuroscience, researchers are currently working on understanding how the brain functions and how it is changed by experience. This research could lead to new treatments for mental health problems and possible cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease. Meanwhile, in computer science, researchers are working on developing advanced virtual reality headsets and other gaming platforms that could revolutionize how people learn new skills. By understanding these two branches of research, scientists can develop better ideas for products and services that would be more effective or fun for users.
