The benefits of being creative
Creativity is often associated with artistic activities such as painting, drawing, and sculpting. However, being creative goes beyond the arts. Creativity is a way of looking at things differently and coming up with new ideas.
There are many benefits to being creative. One benefit is that it can help you solve problems. When you approach a problem from a creative perspective, you are more likely to come up with an original solution.

Another benefit of being creative is that it can help you communicate better. When you have a new idea, you need to be able to communicate it to others clearly. This can be difficult if you are not used to thinking creatively.

Lastly, being creative can simply make you happier. When you engage in creative activities, your brain releases dopamine, which is a feel-good chemical. This can lead to increased levels of happiness and satisfaction.

How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.
