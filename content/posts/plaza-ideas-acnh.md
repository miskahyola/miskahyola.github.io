What are some ways to overcome them?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They can be inspiration or a way to take the next step. Here are three ways to overcome them:
1) Take a break: When it feels like you can't get started, take a break and come back with fresh eyes. With enough time, your new ideas will start to form and you'll be on your way to creating something great.

2) Get organized: Putting everything in one place will make it easier to focus on your project and won't leave any spaces for distractions. Keep track of what you're working on, where you want to go with it, and when you plan to finish so that you don't fall behind.

3) Talk to others: If you're feeling stuck, talking with other startups or experts can give you some great ideas and help get your project moving forward.
