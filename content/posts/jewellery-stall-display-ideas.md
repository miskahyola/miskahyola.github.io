Others might say that innovation is something that comes about when something new and different is created. There isn't one right answer to this question. What matters most, though, is the concept itself- innovation.

How can you come up with big ideas?
Big ideas are important when it comes to coming up with new ideas, but they can also be a challenge. There are a few things you can do to help come up with big ideas that will be successful. The first thing is to think about what you want your idea to achieve. Once you know what your idea is, you can start thinking about how you can make it a reality. Next, take into account the competition. If there are others who have similar ideas, it will be more difficult for them to come up with a better solution than yours. Finally, make sure your idea is feasible. This means that it should not be too much trouble for people to implement your idea, and it should not require too much money or time.
