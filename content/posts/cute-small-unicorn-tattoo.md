Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.

What is big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always come to mind. From economic reforms to social programs, big ideas are always on the radar of policy-makers. However, what exactly makes a good big idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to big ideas, but some key elements include: having a clear vision and goals, being able to develop and test the idea in a meaningful way, and being able to build on existing policies or programs.

This year's Winter Olympics in Sochi may be seen as an opportunity for fresh thinking about big ideas. While many experts predict that the Games will not produce any significant newbig ideas, that does not mean that there is not potential for innovation.
