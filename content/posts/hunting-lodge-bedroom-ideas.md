Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!

The benefits of Innovation
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or business ideas that are conceptually different from those currently in use. In order for an innovation to be successful, it must be novel, easy to adopt, and affordable. There are a number of benefits to pursuing innovation, including increased economic growth, better customer service and reduced costs. Some of the most common benefits of innovation include: 
Increased Economic Growth: Innovation can help businesses increase their profits by creating new products or services that are new and unique enough to draw in customers. By increasing competition, businesses can make more money while reducing their costs.

Improved Customer Service: When customers experience new products or services that are different from those currently in use, they may feel more satisfied with them. This will lead to higher sales and lower costs.
