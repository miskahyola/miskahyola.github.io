Coming Up With Ideas: Offer some tips on how to generate invention ideas.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success. First, try to come up with ideas that solve a problem you encounter in your everyday life. Chances are, if you can find a solution to your own problem, others will be interested in your invention as well. Also, don't be afraid to brainstorm with friends or family members; two heads are better than one when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Finally, keep a notebook or journal handy at all times so you can jot down any inventive thoughts that pop into your head; you never know when inspiration will strike!
