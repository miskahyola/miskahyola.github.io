Creative problem-solving:
Creative problem-solving is a key part of any creative person’s toolbox. By solving problems, you can produce high-quality work. Here are a few tips to help you explore and solve creative problems:
1) Do your research before you start anything. When starting something new, it’s helpful to know what others have done and how they’ve solved similar problems. This will give you an idea of how to approach the problem and what steps should be taken next.

2) Take your time. Don’t try to do too much at once. If you hurry, you might not get the results that you want or need. Time allows for moreassing thought and creates a better atmosphere for creativity.

3) Be patient. Don’t expect everything to go as planned the first time around.
