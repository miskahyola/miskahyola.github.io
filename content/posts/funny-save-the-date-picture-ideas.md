The five types of ideas: Creative, Mental, Proposal, Implementation, and Future.
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all share one common goal: to help change the world. Mental ideas are often more creative and come with less risk than their physical counterparts. Proposal ideas can address problems or challenges that people face every day, implementation ideas can be used to create new products or services, and future-minded ideas provide a roadmap for how something could be turned into a reality.

Trends in technology: How is technology changing?
Technology is constantly evolving, and with it, the way we live and work. In 2020, there are many ideas for how technology will change in the next year. Here are a few examples: 
- digitize everything: physical things will be digitized to the point where they can be stored and accessed from any device. This could include everything from your phone to your books. 
- AI will take over jobs: machines are starting to become smarter than people and can now do most tasks on their own. This could lead to layoffs in the workforce as companies adopt AI strategies to save money. 
- Virtual Reality will take over: our reality will be turned into a virtual one, allowing us to experience different worlds without ever leaving our home. This could have a number of implications, such as making travel more comfortable or increasing creativity.

Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

What is big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always come to mind. From economic reforms to social programs, big ideas are always on the radar of policy-makers. However, what exactly makes a good big idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to big ideas, but some key elements include: having a clear vision and goals, being able to develop and test the idea in a meaningful way, and being able to build on existing policies or programs.

This year's Winter Olympics in Sochi may be seen as an opportunity for fresh thinking about big ideas. While many experts predict that the Games will not produce any significant newbig ideas, that does not mean that there is not potential for innovation.
