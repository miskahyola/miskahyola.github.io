Definition of innovation: Innovation is the process of making something new and better.
Innovation is the process of making something new and better, whether it's a product, service or idea. Innovation is essential for businesses to remain competitive and successful, as it helps them improve their products and services while keeping up with the latest trends.
There are a few key ingredients that must be in place for innovation to work: creativity, determination and a willingness to take risks. However, these three qualities can also be difficult to muster at times. For businesses that want to see innovation take hold, they need to focus on each individual ingredient in order to create an environment where creativity can thrive and risk-taking is encouraged.
