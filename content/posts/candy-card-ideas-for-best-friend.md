In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don‚Äôt really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.
