What are some of the most common invention ideas?
Inventions have helped humanity in many ways, from small gadgets to major advances in technology. Here are a few of the most common invention ideas:
1. Digital watches: In 1844, Swiss scientist Leonhard Euler invented the wristwatch, which allowed people to track their time and date more easily.
2. Air conditioning: In cooling off after a hot day, people would often open windows to air out their homes and families. In 1927, American engineer Charles Lindbergh patented an air conditioner that could be controlled by Pitot tubes to keep rooms cool on hot days.
3. Electric cars: Tesla Motors created the first electric car in 1938 and began production that year. By 1947, over half a million electric cars had been sold worldwide!
