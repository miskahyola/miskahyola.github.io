Creative art can be both therapeutic and functional. Therapeutic in that it can help to clear away any emotional or material debris that has built up in the individual, and functional as it can help people to express themselves in a new and unique way.

3. It can provideah opportunity for self-expression that is often overshadowed by more pressing concerns.
