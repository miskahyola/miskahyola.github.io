Stop before you're too far: Sometimes it's better to stop when you're ahead of schedule.
One popular way to avoid becoming too far behind schedule is to take some time off from work and do things you enjoy. This can be done by either creating a plan or just taking a break. Other ideas for dealing with the feeling of being too far behind may include considering using a calendar app to keep track of when you will have other opportunities, setting goals for yourself that you can hit once you've caught up, or using a timer to keep track of how long it will take you to complete a task. When making decisions about when and how to take breaks, it's important to weigh the pros and cons according to what type of work we're doing.

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
