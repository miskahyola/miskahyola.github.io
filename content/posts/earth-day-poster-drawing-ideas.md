It's no secret that the opening of your article is important. After all, it's the first thing readers will see and it needs to be attention-grabbing enough to make them want to continue reading. Here are some ideas on how to do just that:

2. Write in a clear and concise manner. No one wants to wade through a bunch of fluff in order to get to the good stuff. Get straight to the point and make every word count.

The 5 Types of Ideas: Creative, Strategic, Normative, Primal, and Vague.
Creative ideas can be anything, but they typically fall into one of five types: strategic, normative, Primal, and vague. 
Strategic ideas are those that focus on the overall strategy of a project or organization. Normative ideas deal with how things should be done in order to achieve a certain result. Primal ideas are the raw materials that creative minds start with and use to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. Vague ideas are those that are too general or abstract for anyone to really understand them without more information.
