1. Establish your tone and voice. Once you've come up with a good concept, it's important to establish a tone in order to sell it.

2. Research your marketability. Once you have a solid tone and voice, it's time to research the marketability of your ideas. Do you have an existing audience? Are your concepts easy to understand?
