What is the best way to approach new ideas?
New ideas are always something to be taken with a grain of salt, but there are a few things that can help make them more palatable. One approach is to ask yourself what the potential benefits of the idea are. If you can find an example of how the idea could be used in your field or business, it can help make it more palatable. Another thing to keep in mind is that new ideas should not be taken lightly - if they seem too good to be true, they probably are. However, by taking a step back and investigating the potential benefits, you can form a better opinion of whether or not this is something that would work for you.

What Causes Innovation?
Innovation can be explained in a few ways. One way is to say that innovation comes from change. Another way to think about it is that innovation happens when something new and different comes along and helps someone or something do what they were supposed to do but didn't actually do it. 
One of the biggest reasons for innovation is often because someone needs a new product or service to solve a problem that they didn't previously have. Innovation also happens when people come up with new ways of doing things, or coming up with new ways to make things better.
