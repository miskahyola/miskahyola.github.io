1) In order to increase youth engagement with politics and policy, the government should provide more opportunities for marginalized groups like youth of color and low-income families to participate in civic engagement. 
2) To create an engaged electorate, the government could invest in marketing and public education campaigns that promote informed voting. 
3) To promote economic growth and create jobs, the government should focus on initiatives like issuing tax breaks and investing in renewable energy sources. 
4) To improve quality of life for residents, the government should focus on issues like affordable housing, accessible education, health care access, and green infrastructure.

How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?
