The Problem: How do we create meaningful ideas?
In order to create meaningful ideas, we need a strong understanding of what those ideas mean and how to put those ideas into practice. Unfortunately, most people lack these foundational skills. In order to get started, here are some basic tips: 
1. Think about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you determine how your idea can be used and adapted. 
2. Brainstorm with others for feedback andIdea generation challenges can be fun, but also helpful in getting feedback on whether or not your idea is conceptually good or bad. 
3. Come up with a working title for your idea before you even start thinking about it. This will give you an idea of what the word “idea” means and make sure that everyone who hears your idea understands it at its purest form (i.e., without any additional context).
