The Power of Big Ideas
The power of big ideas is at the root of most innovation. Ideas that are large enough to engage people and make a difference can touch every aspect of our lives. From the simplest things to the biggest challenges, big ideas can impact everything and everyone around them.
There are a number of ways to create big ideas, but some are easier than others. One approach is to come up with a concept that you’re passionate about and then explore what others have said about it. Another way is to read articles, watch videos, or listen to lectures on different topics in order to develop an idea for your business or product.

Whatever method you choose, remember that big ideas are worth pursuing – no matter how challenging or difficult they may seem at first.

Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether you’re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.
