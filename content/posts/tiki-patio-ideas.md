What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.
