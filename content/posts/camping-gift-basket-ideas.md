What is invention?
Invention is the creation of a new product or idea. It can be anything from an improvement on an existing product to a completely new design. Inventions can have a huge impact on society, and sometimes they are the stuff of legends.
Many inventions are based on ideas that were first floated around in Hungary during the 18th century. These include the Hungarian alphabet, which was created by Nicholas-Jacques Conte in 1795, and the gypsy ballpoint pen, which was developed by Ferenc Pusk√°s in 1912. Other famous inventions include the Segway vehicle and the Heath Robinson helicopters.
