Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

Tips for creating unique and interesting blog posts: How can you make your posts stand out from the rest?
Creating interesting and unique blog posts is a key part of any online writer’s repertoire. There are a number of ways to go about this, but one way that can really set your blog apart from the rest is by using creative writing techniques. Here are some tips for trying out these techniques:

3. Think outside the box when it comes to plot points and ideas. Not all blog posts need an obvious solution, and instead, you can use them as a jumping off point for new storylines or characters for your blog post.
