what brainstorming is, how to do it
Brainstorming is a technique used to generate ideas for a project or problem. To brainstorm, you simply need to allow your mind to wander and come up with as many ideas as possible. There are no wrong answers in brainstorming, so don't worry about being too creative. Just let your thoughts flow and see where they take you.
To get started, find a quiet place where you can relax and focus on the task at hand. Then, set a timer for 10-15 minutes and start writing down whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about editing or critiquing your ideas at this stage; just let them flow freely. Once the timer goes off, you can start looking through your list of ideas and identifying which ones are the most promising.

How do you make your blog stand out from the rest?
There are a few things you can do to make your blog stand out from the rest. Here are some ideas: 
1. Use a unique tagline. This will help people know where they can find your blog, and it will also help you attract more traffic.

2. Make your blog content interesting and helpful. People want to read helpful, informative posts, not just those that are empty calories or boring information dumps.

3. Be funny and entertaining. Blogging is a fun hobby, so make sure your content is both enjoyable and informative too!

4. Be original. When other bloggers start using the same template or style for their blogs, it becomes difficult for them to stand out from the crowd. So be unique and think outside the box!
