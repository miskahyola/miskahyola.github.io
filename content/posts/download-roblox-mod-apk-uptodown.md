Defining big ideas
What are Big Ideas?
Big Ideas are complex concepts that can be difficult to understand. They are often used in fields such as philosophy, religion, and science.

There are many different ways to define Big Ideas. One common definition is that they are ideas that have a profound impact on the way we see the world. Another definition is that they are concepts that are difficult to fully explain.

Big Ideas often challenge our existing beliefs and ways of thinking. They can be controversial and provoke debate. But ultimately, they help us to see the world in new and different ways.
