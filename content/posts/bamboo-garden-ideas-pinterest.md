How to: Start with the most common projects and work your way up
If you're just starting out, there are a few things to keep in mind when embarking on your first DIY project. First and foremost, don't be afraid to ask for help – everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to construction. And if you have any trouble understanding something or struggling with a project, don't worry; anyone can learn from experience.
Of course, no one is born knowing how to do everything by themselves – that's where the importance of having some type of plan comes in. Not only will this help you avoid becoming overwhelmed and frustrated, but it'll also make sure that your projects get completed on time and without any unforeseen problems. So go ahead and start building – it's the least you can do!

What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.
