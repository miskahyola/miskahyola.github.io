The creative process: How does one go about coming up with an invention?
Invention ideas come to us in all forms- written, verbal, or graphical. Some people start with the idea of what they want to create and then work backwards from there. Others have a pure invention idea that is completely new and has no precedent within the industry. There is no right or wrong way to come up with an invention, as long as it's creative and futuristic. The process of coming up with an invention begins by brainstorming different ideas on paper or on a computer. Once you've collected a few good ideas, it's time to get them down on paper or in your head for further thought. Once you've created some rough sketches, it's time for refinement and development. The next step is testing- doing research on the subject matter you're consideringbefore submitting your product to market.

What are some challenges to using brainstroming?
There are some challenges to using brainstroming, which is a technique used in sales and marketing. Brainstroming is a cognitive process that helps people understand the needs of others and convert those needs into actionable insights. By understanding the customer's goals, Brainstroming can help you generate ideas for products or services that match those goals.
One challenge with brainstroming is that it is often difficult to determine where to start. One approach is to focus on one area of weakness or interest, but this can be time-consuming and difficult. Another challenge is that it can be difficult to know when the insight has been generated and tested in a controlled environment.
