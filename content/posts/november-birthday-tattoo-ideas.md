Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
Big ideas are those that have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. There are many big ideas out there, but it can be tough to find the right one to bring about big results. Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

2. A new payment method that allows anyone with an internet connection and a phone or tablet device to easily pay for goods and services using their phones or tablets.

What is big ideas and what are they good for?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. If left unchecked, big ideas can lead to important innovations that may solve world problems or improve society as a whole. However, before any big idea can be successful, it must be properly vetted and tested. This process involves understanding what is big and what is not. When done correctly, these tests can help determine if the idea is safe and viable for implementation.
