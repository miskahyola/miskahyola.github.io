-Start with smaller pieces. Start by trying out a couple of different ideas and seeing what pops into your mind. This will give you a base from which to build more complex concepts around. 
-Capture the idea in an easily remembered phrase or image. This will help you retain the memory for as long as possible and will encourage you to come up with other similar ideas. 
-Ask around. Go online, talk to friends, or attend meeting after meeting to see if anyone has any specific ideas about what you’re looking for. This way, you won’t have to start from scratch every time you want to think of something new.

The Types of Ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas can be classified into two main groups: propositional and non propositional. Propositional ideas are those that have a conclusion, or an idea about what something means. Non propositional ideas, on the other hand, do not have a conclusion, but rather they are about how something might happen.
