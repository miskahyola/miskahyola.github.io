Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.

How can brainstroming be used in your business?
Do you want to know how you can use brainstroming in your business? If yes, read on. Brainstroming is a powerful tool that can help you understand your customer and find new areas of growth for your business. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Legitimate brainstroming should start with understanding what your customers want and need. This information should be gathered through customer surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Once you have this information, you can begin exploring different areas of customer needs and desires.

2. Use brainstroming to reach out to customers who have not interacted with you before. Reach out to customers who may be interested in what you have to offer but haven’t had the opportunity to speak with you yet. This will help increase brand awareness and build trust between yourself and your customers.
