What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products or services that are better than the ones that are currently available. Innovation can be seen as the continuous evolution of ideas and concepts, whether those ideas come from scientists, engineers, businessmen, or anyone else who has an idea for a new product or service. Innovation is also the result of using new technologies and methods to improve upon older ones.
The term "innovation" can be used in different ways depending on who is talking about it. One meaning would be taking something old and making it better, while another could refer to putting something new into use to improve performance. Whatever the definition, innovation is important and always in search of improvement.
