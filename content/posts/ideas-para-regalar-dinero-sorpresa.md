Conclusion: How to come up with big ideas and what they mean for your business or project.
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always apply: think outside the box, brainstorm, and be flexible. With that in mind, here are five tips on how to come up with big ideas for your business or project: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or project to achieve. What problems do you want to solve? What goals do you want to achieve? This will give you a good starting point for brainstorming ideas. 
2. Be open to other suggestions. When you’re brainstorming, don’t be afraid to take other people’s suggestions into account. If someone has an idea that sounds great but doesn’t quite fit your project, don’t be afraid to change it up a bit – after all, this is brainstorming!

The Process of Invention: How ideas are born and developed
Invention is the process by which new ideas are born and developed. It starts with a brainstorming session, where people come up with ideas for products or services. Next, the team that will be working on developing these ideas must come up with a plan for how to make this idea a reality. This includes coming up with a concept, creating drawings, and finally making prototypes. Once these prototypes have been created, it is then important to test them to see if they are effective. If not, then the team must go back and revise their plan until they are successful.
