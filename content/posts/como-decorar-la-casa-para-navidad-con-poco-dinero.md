There are a few things you can do to come up with big ideas. The first is to think about what you want to accomplish. Once you have an idea of what it is that you want, the next step is to come up with a plan for achieving it. You can use whatever methods work for you, but some tips on coming up with big ideas:

2. Come up with specific examples of how your goal can be accomplished using common methods and resources. This will give you a deep understanding of what is required and make the process easier.

3. Brainstorm with other people on how best to achieve your goal using their expertise and resources.
