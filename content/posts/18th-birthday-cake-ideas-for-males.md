Stimulating creativity with prompts:
When it comes to creativity, there are a variety of ways to get those ideas flowing. One way is to use prompts. Prompts can help to stimulate the creative process by providing a structure or framework within which to generate ideas.
There are a number of different types of prompts that can be used, depending on what you’re looking to achieve. For example, if you’re looking for ideas for a new project, you might use a prompt that asks you to come up with three possible options for what that project could be.

If you’re struggling with writer’s block, on the other hand, you might use a prompt that gives you a specific topic or scenario to write about. The key is to find a prompt that works for you and your current needs.

Group brainstorming
Group brainstorming can be a powerful tool for coming up with invention ideas. By pooling the creative resources of a group of people, you can come up with ideas that you might never have thought of on your own.
To get the most out of group brainstorming, it's important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means establishing ground rules that allow for open and honest discussion without judgement. Once you've established this safe space, encourage everyone to share their ideas freely. The more diverse the perspectives in the group, the better!

With a little creativity and some outside-the-box thinking, group brainstorming can be a great way to generate new invention ideas.
