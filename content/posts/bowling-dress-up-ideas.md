Inspiration from nature:
Creative ideas come from all around nature. Sometimes they are simple, like a flower that can be picked up with your hands, or an animal that is easy to look at but hard to understand. Other times they are more complicated, like the way a tree grows or the way a bee collects nectar. Whatever creative ideas you come up with, make sure they are based on something you have seen in nature and that you can understand.
