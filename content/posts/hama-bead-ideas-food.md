Origins of creativity: The human brain's ability to come up with new ideas.
Creativity has a long and mysterious history. Scientists have been trying to understand its origins for decades, but there is still much to learn about how creativity evolved. There are several theories about how creativity comes about, but one of the most popular is the “genetic lottery” theory. This theory posits that creativity emerges from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Other theories focus on the role of the hippocampus, which is tucked deep inside the brainstem. The hippocampus helps us remember new ideas and can be important in helping us come up with new solutions to problems. While there is still much to learn about how creativity works, these theories offer some interesting insights into its origins.

What to include in your blog:
Blogging can be a fun and rewarding way to share your thoughts, experiences, and ideas with the world. However, not all bloggers have everything they need in their blog to make it successful. Some bloggers may lack important pieces of equipment or content that can damage their blog's popularity and cause them to lose traffic and followers. Here are some tips on what to include in your blog so that you can achieve great success:
1. Make Your Blog Name glaringly obvious: The first thing most people will notice when they visit your blog is the name. This should be the first thing you focus on making sure is correctly spelled and easily remembered. If you cannot remember your blog's name, it will likely suffer from low popularity and fewer visitors.
