What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.

What are the different types of art you can create? What is the difference between creative and non-creative art? Why is creativity important?
Creative art is often characterized by its unique and expressive elements. It can be considered to be an individual form of expression, or a way to express oneself. Non-creative art, on the other hand, is often based on the same parameters as creative art but does not typically have as much expressive power. It can be considered more bland or conventional.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a big help when it comes to solving problems. Ideas can also help you see things in a new light or come up with new ideas for projects. There are many benefits to having ideas and some people swear by the power of them. Here are three reasons why you should try out ideas at least once: 
- When you have an idea, it can force you to think about what else could be done. This can lead to new ideas, which in turn can lead to new projects. 
- Ideas are often more efficient than what is currently being done. When you have an idea, you can get started on it even if it’s not perfect and that makes the process of learning more efficient. 
- Ideas give people the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions with others.
