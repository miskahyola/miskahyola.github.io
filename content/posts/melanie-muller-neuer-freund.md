How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you?
How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you? There are a number of ways to do this, but one of the most effective methods is by asking yourself what interests you. This will help you to develop ideas based on what you care about, and it will also help to narrow down your options. The next step is to look through existing ideas and see which ones might be a good fit for you. Once you have narrowed down your options, it’s time to start exploring them, by looking for examples and reading about them. Finally, keep in mind that not all ideas are created equal, so be prepared to test and experiment before making any decisions.

1. Create a custom desk with an old dresser
If you're like most people, your work desk is more a collection of random pieces of furniture than an organized working space. It's easy to get disorganized when you don't have a specific goal in mind when designing your desk. So how do you create an actual working space for yourself? One way is to find an old dresser and turn it into a custom desk. You can use the drawer space for storage, or simply use the top drawer as a place to put your computer, printer, and other office supplies. This project can be completed in just a few hours, and it's a great way to show off your skills as an architect.
