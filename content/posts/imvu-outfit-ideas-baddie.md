Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it‚Äôs something that people actually need or want. Once you‚Äôve done that, it‚Äôs time to start working on making your invention a reality.

New models for innovation: How can new models for innovation be introduced into current practices to improve outcomes?
Innovation is an ever-evolving process that can improve outcomes by introducing new models and concepts into current practices. Several recent studies have shown that innovation can lead to increased success in terms of productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction. However, there are some challenges that need to be overcome before innovation can be successful. One challenge is the fear of change, which can impede the development of new models and concepts. Another challenge is the lack of evidence that a model will work in practice, which can limit the impact of innovation. Finally, there is the need for regulatory support in order to ensure that innovations are brought to market successfully.
