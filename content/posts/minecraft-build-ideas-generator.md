Conclusion: How does brainstorming work? How do you come up with great ideas? What makes good ones? Is there a difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions?
In any business, brainstorming is a process that often helps to come up with great ideas. It can be used as part of an overall strategy or as a standalone tool. The most important thing is to find the right way to use it and to make sure it’s effective. There are two main types of brainstorming: formal and informal. Formal brainstorming typically takes place in a group setting and is focused on coming up with specific solutions to problems. In contrast, informal brainstorming can take place in your own time and can be more creative. It can involve anything from talking about your ideas with friends to simply coming up with your thoughts on the matter at hand. While there’s no one way to do brainstorming, using both forms will help you come up with more innovative ways to solve problems and come up with better ideas.

The definition of creativity
Creativity is a mental process which refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, solutions or products. It can be described in different ways but ultimately it is what makes us unique and makes us stand out from the rest. Creative art is often seen as an area where creativity flourishes, as it offers an escape from reality and allows people to become creative problem solvers. In order to be considered creative, an artist must have a strong imagination, be able to see things in a new light and be willing to experiment.
