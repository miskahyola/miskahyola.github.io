Changes in the job market: 2019 predictions for the US economy
The job market continues to grow, with new jobs being created at a steady clip. But the future of the economy is still uncertain, as there are several possible trends that could affect the job market in the next few years. 
One trend that could have an impact on the job market is a rise in automation. This technology is slowly changing the way businesses operate, and as it does, many jobs will become obsolete or difficult to fill. As automation takes hold, many people may have to move into new positions, which could lead to increased unemployment rates. 

Another potential trend that could affect the job market in the next few years is a rise in wages. This increase may be due to factors such as better economic conditions and rising productivity levels. However, it can also happen as a result of negotiations between companies and unions over wages.

For example, if you’re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium. However, if you’re a sculptor and you want to create pieces that are dark and moody, then you might use painting as your medium.
