What is innovation and why is it so important?
The term “innovation” has been around for a long time, but its meaning has changed over time. In the old days, innovation referred to new technology or products. But in the days of digital age, innovation also refers to how we can use technology to improve our lives and businesses.
Innovation is key because it allows companies and individuals to perpetually alter their way of doing things and produce new ideas that can make a difference.
