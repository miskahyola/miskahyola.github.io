Introduce the topic of invention ideas
Most people never think about invention ideas until they see a commercial for a new product on television. Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market. The process of invention is one that takes a lot of time, energy and dedication. Inventors are some of the most creative people in the world. They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.

Innovation: How can you make your inventions more successful?
Inventions can be a great way to make your business more successful. By coming up with new ways to do things, you can make your products or services more affordable and accessible, or even create new markets for them. Here are four tips for making your inventions more successful:
1. Think about what customers want. When you come up with an invention, think about the needs that your target market might have. What are the products or services that you could offer that would meet those needs?
2. Look at the competition. Make sure that you’re not just copying someone else’s idea, but coming up with a better solution that will be more popular and successful. There are always new opportunities out there for businesses to succeed, so don’t be afraid to creativity and risk taking!
