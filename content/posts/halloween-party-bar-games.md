The artist as creator: How does the artist create their art?
Creative artists create their art through a variety of mediums and techniques. They use their creative juices to express themselves, and often work in collaboration with others to produce unique pieces of art. While the artist's process is unique, it ultimately remains the same: they start with a blank canvas, and take turns working on different aspects of their artwork until it is finished.
