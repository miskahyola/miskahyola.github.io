How to Choose the PerfectDIY Project: What factors should you consider when choosing a DIY project?
When looking to DIY, there are a few things to consider. The first is budget. It’s always important to be mindful of how much money we’re willing to spend on something, and whether or not we think it will be worth the time and effort involved. Another thing to consider is what type of project we want to undertake. There are a wide variety of DIY projects available, from simple projects that can be completed in minutes to more complex projects that can take weeks or even months. Once you have your idea for a DIY project, however, the next step is choosing the right one for you. Here are eight factors you should consider when choosing aDIY project: 
1) What type of material will the project be done with?
2) How much work will it involve?
3) What kind of finished product do we want?

What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.
