How to: Start with the most common projects and work your way up
If you're just starting out, there are a few things to keep in mind when embarking on your first DIY project. First and foremost, don't be afraid to ask for help – everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to construction. And if you have any trouble understanding something or struggling with a project, don't worry; anyone can learn from experience.
Of course, no one is born knowing how to do everything by themselves – that's where the importance of having some type of plan comes in. Not only will this help you avoid becoming overwhelmed and frustrated, but it'll also make sure that your projects get completed on time and without any unforeseen problems. So go ahead and start building – it's the least you can do!

Idea Generation: How do you generate new ideas?
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but there’s something about generating new ones that makes them stand out. If you can come up with an interesting and innovative idea, your next project will be much more successful. Here are 5 tips to help you generate fresh ideas:
1. Take a step back and think about what you want to achieve. When you come up with an original idea, it’s important to focus on what the product or service could do for someone else. What problems could it solve? Who would be interested in using it?

2. Be persistent and keep exploring. Don't give up if your first suggested solution isn't perfect. Keep trying until you find the right combination of ideas and resources that work for you and your business.

3. Talk to people who use the product or service regularly.

What is brainstroming and why is it important?
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the phenomenon of increased focus and productivity during periods of intense thought or concentration. Brainstroming is often seen as a benefit to people who are able to keep their minds focused on one task for more than a short period of time. Some believe that brainstroming can be used to improve problem solving, creativity, and decision making. However, there are several caveats to note when it comes to brainstroming. First, brainstroming can be difficult to maintain for any length of time; second, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving maximal effectiveness; and third, individuals respond differently to different types of brainstroming interventions.
