Innovation is the process of introducing a new product or method to improve the efficiency and quality of an existing product. It can be defined in many ways, but one definition defines it as follows: "the creation of a new idea, design, technology, or business model that replaces an older one." Innovation can come from anywhere in the organization, but it often happens in those areas that are closest to customers and users.

Types of creativity: The five types of creativity.
Creativity is an important factor in any business. Whether it’s a creative idea for a new product, or taking on a new challenge, creativity can help businesses succeed. Here are five different types of creativity that can help your business thrive:
