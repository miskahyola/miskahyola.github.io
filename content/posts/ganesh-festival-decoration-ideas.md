Types of ideas: What should be in a good idea?
Ideas are a vital ingredient in any business or product. They can be used to originate new concepts, improve on an existing product, or create a new market. However, how well ideas are executed can greatly affect their success. Here are a few tips on how to make your ideas executable:
1. Be specific: The first step in Executing an Idea is to be specific about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you to focus and ensure that your idea is communicated effectively.

2. Be Efficient: Once you have identified what you want your idea to achieve, it is important to focus on how best to achieve it within the confines of your time and resources. This means being efficient in both the development of your idea and the execution of it.

Ideas that work: Why do some ideas work and others don't?
Creative ideas are often the most successful, but it can be tough to know why. Here are four reasons:
1. You have to be willing to try something.
2. What you think is working may not be working for others, so you have to come up with a new idea that does what they want and works for you.
3. Your idea might not be original, but it's more likely to work because it's been tried before or because someone else has already created a similar product or service that people are using and liking.
4. Your idea might be better than what's currently out there, so give your stuff a go and see whether it works or not – even if it doesn't quite fit the mold of what everyoneelse is doing!
