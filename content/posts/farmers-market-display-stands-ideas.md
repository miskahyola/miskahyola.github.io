How creativity manifests in different people: Inventors are the most creative, while artists are more creative when they have a personal connection to their work
Creativity is not only evident in inventors, but also in artists. When artists have a personal connection to their creativity, they are more likely to express it. This has been shown by many studies that show creativity flourishes when people have close relationships with others. For example, according as the work of Dr. Philippa Parris and Dr. Christopher Lasch shows, creative people are more willing to communicate their ideas and feelings than those who do not have such a relationship. 
However, the connection between artist and inventor does not always exist. In some cases, the two groups of people may be completely different in terms of creativity. Also, it is important to note that creativity does not come from having one’s ideas constantly tested or experimented with; it generally comes from being open-minded andCEPTIVE towards new ideas.

HistoricalBackground: Invention refers to the use of new ideas or devices to improve or complete a task.
Invention is the use of new ideas or devices to improve or complete a task. The history of invention is filled with stories of people who came up with new ways to do things, and often these ideas led to new products, services, or treatments. Today, we continue to see innovation in all areas of life, from technology to fashion. In some cases, this has led to profound change for the world around us - for example, the development of the printing press and the telephone. In other cases, it has just meant more innovation in the ways we work and live.
