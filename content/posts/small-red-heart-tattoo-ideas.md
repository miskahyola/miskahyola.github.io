How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

Lessons learned from innovation: What have been some of the most successful implementations?
Innovation is a process of making something better. In technology, innovation often refers to the birth of new products or technologies, or the alteration of a design to make it more efficient, effective, or user-friendly. Innovation has been successful in many industries and sectors over the years, but there are some lessons that can be learned from some of the most successful implementations.
One such example is Google's Gmail, which was first introduced in 2000 and became wildly popular. The service allowed users to easily communicate with one another without having to leave their computers. It also became one of the first online services to offer free email storage for users. In addition, Gmail was originally designed as a way for small businesses to connect with larger companies and share files easier than ever before.
