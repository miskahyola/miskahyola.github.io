Trends in mobility: How is mobile technology affecting business and how will it impact the future of work?
Mobile technology is slowly but surely affecting business as more and more people move around the world. This has a big impact on the future of work, as businesses have to adapt to the needs of their customers who are increasingly using mobile devices for work purposes. Here are some ideas for how mobile technology will affect business in 2022:
1) The rise in mobile phone ownership: In 2020, over 50% of Australians had a mobile phone, up from just 25% in 2009. This has led to a big increase in the demand for data and voice services. As people becomemore reliant on their phones for work purposes, companies need to be prepared to offer good deals on data and voice rates.

2) The shift towards digital working: Technology has been gradually getting better at letting people collaborate through electronic means.
