Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.
