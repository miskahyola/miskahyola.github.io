Inventions can come from anyone - a small business owner, inventor, scientist or just someone who has an idea for a better way to do something. Some of the most famous inventions include the computer, the telephone and theimplication machine.

The key is to ensure that ideas are properly considered before they are turned into an invention - anything can happen in this process!
