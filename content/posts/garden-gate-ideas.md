Conclusion
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First, don’t worry about coming up with the “right” answer. There is no such thing when you’re brainstorming. The whole point is to come up with as many ideas as possible, even if they’re not all good. Second, allow yourself to think outside the box. The best ideas often come from thinking in a way that you wouldn’t normally. And finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Brainstorming with someone else can give you some great new perspectives on an issue.
