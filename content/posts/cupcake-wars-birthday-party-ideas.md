brainstorming: How do you start brainstorming?
brainstorming is a powerful tool that can lead to creative ideas. But it can also be difficult to start brainstorming. Here are four tips to help you get started: 
1. Make a list of the main ideas you want to explore. This will give you a starting point for your brainstorming sessions.
2. Take some time to think about what you want your brainstorming session to be about. What are the main topics that you want to cover? 
3. Get feedback from other people who will help you shape your ideas into a better idea. This can include fellow creatives, business owners, or other people in your industry. 
4. Use the tools that work best for you when brainstorming: paper, pencils, computers, or flashcards can all be used in different ways during a brainstorming session.
