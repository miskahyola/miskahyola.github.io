Development and commercialization: How do you make money from your invention?
Invention ideas are all around us. Whether it's a new product or an idea for a new company, something can be invented and made into a business. There are many ways to monetize an invention, but there is one way that is always popular and payout: profit sharing. Profit sharing is when an inventor gets a percentage of the sales generated from their invention. It can be a great way to make some extra money while your invention remains in the public domain. There are different types of profit sharing, but one of the most common is share-the- wealth, which means that inventors receive a cut of any profits made by their invention. There are also royalty shares, which give inventors a share of the royalties received from selling their invention.

What are some creative methods?
Creative methods can be anything from painting to sculpting, but they all have one common goal: to help you achieve your creative goals. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Get organized: When it comes to creative endeavors, organization is key. Not only will this help you keep track of what you’re working on, but it can also inspire you to come up with new ideas. Try keeping a binder or portfolio around with all of your creative works, as well as any sketches, paintings, or sculptures that you may have created in the past. 
2. Draw inspiration from nature: One of the best ways to get inspired by your work is to draw inspiration from nature. Not only will this give you a strong grounding in composition and color, but it can also provide inspiration for new ideas and concepts.
