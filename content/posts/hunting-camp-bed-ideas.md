The Process of Invention: How ideas are born and developed
Invention is the process by which new ideas are born and developed. It starts with a brainstorming session, where people come up with ideas for products or services. Next, the team that will be working on developing these ideas must come up with a plan for how to make this idea a reality. This includes coming up with a concept, creating drawings, and finally making prototypes. Once these prototypes have been created, it is then important to test them to see if they are effective. If not, then the team must go back and revise their plan until they are successful.
