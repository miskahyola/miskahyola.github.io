The concept of brainstroming: what it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of focusing one’s attention on one specific topic and then taking deep, calming breaths. It can be used as a tool for focus, relaxation, and problem-solving. Brainstroming can be done in any situation, but it is most effective when used during meditation or stress relief. Here are five tips for using brainstroming to achieve success:
1. Make sure you have an EMPATHY FOR THE TOPIC YOU ARE FOCUSING ON.

Before beginning brainstroming, it is important to have an understanding of the topic you are trying to focus on. If you don’t care about the issue at hand, your mind will become clouded with distractions and it will be difficult to find the energy necessary to focus on the task at hand.

The role of creativity in art: What does it mean for the artist?
Creativity has been in the eye of the beholder since Antiquity. Whether it be in painting, architecture or music, creativity is what makes art. However, what does creativity actually mean for an artist? In classical times, creativity was considered to be a gift from God. Today, we understand that creativity is something that can be developed through practice and practice can take many different forms. For example, a musician may learn how to play an instrument and then use that knowledge to create new music. An artist may learn how to paint and then use their creative skills to create works of art. While there is no set definition for creativity, most agree that it includes the ability to see things differently than others and to come up with new ideas. In other words, creativity is a state of being where one's thoughts and feelings drive their actions.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.
