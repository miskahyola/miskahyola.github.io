How can people come up with big ideas that will help them achieve their goals?
People often come up with ideas for big goals in different ways – some through brainstorming, others through cold hard thinking. It can be difficult to know where to start when trying to come up with big ideas, but here are a few tips that could help:
1. Keep your big idea simple: When you have a bunch of ideas floating around your head, it can be hard to focus on just one. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable chunks and work on one at a time. This will make it easier to see the connection between them and make sure you are actually on the same page as your team or clients.

2. Be creative: If you’re not always comfortable following through with your ideas, try giving them a whirl some other way. What if you turned this idea into a reality?

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.
