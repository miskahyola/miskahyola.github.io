The role of innovation in business: What are some applications of innovation?
Innovation is a term that is often used in business to describe new ideas or methods that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a business. This can be achieved through technological innovations, business model changes, or even product design changes. In recent years, innovation has become more important in businesses as it has become more difficult for companies to stay afloat with traditional methods such as investment and marketing.

What is the process of creating big ideas?
How do you come up with big ideas? There are many ways to do it, but the process is usually something like this: 1. Come up with a general idea. This could be anything from the beginning of your problem to the end of your solution. 2. research what others have done on the topic. This could include reading articles, listening to podcast episodes, or consulting with other business professionals. 3. define what you want your idea to achieve. Make sure this is clear and concise so you can focus on creating a great plan for making it happen. 4. come up with some specific examples of what you imagine your idea might look like and how it would help someone or something else. 5. come up with a timeline for when you expect to see results from your idea and how much money or time will be required in order for that to happen
