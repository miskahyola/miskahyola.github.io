The definition of creativity
Creativity is a wide and undefined term that can mean many different things to many different people. To some, creativity means experiencing new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply having fun. To others, creativity means being able to come up with solutions to problems or coming up with unique ideas that other people might not have thought of. There is no right or wrong answer to this question as what matters most is how you use creativity in your life.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.
