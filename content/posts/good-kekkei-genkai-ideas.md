Conclusion: Why should we be interested in innovation?
Innovation is an ever-growing field of science and technology that is changing the way we do things. It offers a new perspective on how to improve products, services and ideas. Innovation has the ability to change the course of history, and it’s important for businesses to be interested in it. Here are four reasons why innovation should be on businesses’ radar:
1) Innovation can create new opportunities: When companies explore new ways to produce or distribute their products or services, they can find new customers and potentially new markets. This can lead to increased profits and growth.

2) Innovation can save money: Innovation often leads to cost savings, which can help make businesses more profitable. For example, imagine a company that finds a way to produce a product without using traditional methods. This could lead to significant savings in production costs.
