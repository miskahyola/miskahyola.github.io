What are some big ideas?
Big ideas can be everything from initiating change to creating a new product or service. Here are some of the most commonly cited big ideas:
1. Create a new business model: A lot of businesses start with good intentions, but eventually fall short because they don't have a clear plan for how to turn their idea into a reality. One way to overcome this obstacle is to come up with radical new ideas that could help your business succeed.

2. Implement change: Change is always necessary in order for businesses to grow and succeed. Sometimes, it means taking risks that might not be seen as safe or sexy, but it can lead to real results. It's also important to remember that change takes time - sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time so you can make sure your business is on the right track before making any big changes.

Technology: How has technology changed the way we live and work?
Technology has changed the way we live and work. Today, there are more ways to connect with friends and family than ever before. With technology, we can do things that were once impossible. For example, I can now watch my favorite show when Iâ€™m at home without having to leave my couch. Technology has also allowed us to do things that were once impossible. For example, I can now work from home and get a high-paying job. Technology has also changed the way we think about work. Previously, work was seen as a necessary evil that was bad for our health and soul. However, with technology, work is no longer seen as necessary. Today, many people see work as an opportunity to learn new skills and grow their career.
