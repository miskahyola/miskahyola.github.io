Origins of Innovation: Why do people invest in innovation?
Innovation is a term that is used to describe a range of different activities and ideas that have the potential to make a difference in someone’s life. Some of the reasons why people might invest in innovation include wanting to change the world, feeling like they can do something better than anyone else, or simply needing a new idea to try out. There are many different types of innovation, and each has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. One of the most important things to remember when considering whether or not innovation is right for you is to ask yourself what you need it for. If you don’t think you need it, then chances are it won’t be an important part of your Innovation strategy.
