Ideas are everything. They can be helpful, or simply annoying. They can be what we think of when we think of something, or what other people might have in mind for us. Ideas can also be the starting point for new ideas, or the idea behind something we’ve been thinking about for a while but haven’t had the courage to bring to life.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
