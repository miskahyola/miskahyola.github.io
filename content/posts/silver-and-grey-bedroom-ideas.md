A few Tips for Using Brainstroming to Improve Your Life
Brainstroming can help improve your thinking and productivity, especially if you're struggling with a specific problem or goal. Here are a few tips for using brainstroming to get started: 
1. Get organized: Brainstroming can help you focus on one task at a time, which can make it easier to succeed at your goal. Keep track of your thoughts and ideas in an easily accessible place, and use that information to jumpstart your brainstorming process. 

2. Take some time for yourself: Brainstorming is a great way to clear your head and come up with new ideas. However, don't work on your project for hours on end – set some limits and let the brainstorming process take its course.

Why it's important to have a growth plan
It's important to have a growth plan because it sets expectations for the future and helps you stay on track. By knowing what you want, and how to get there, you can create an achievable plan that will help your business grow. Here are three key ideas to help build your growth plan: 
1. Know your industry and where you fit in. Knowing where your business is in the market and what competition is doing will help you determine what needs to be done next in order for your business to stay afloat. 
2. Create a market research strategy. Doing market research will help identify which channels work best for your audience and which ones need more attention or marketing investment. Doing this before starting any new project helps minimize surprises later on. 
3. Set realistic goals and timetables.

The different types of brainstroming:
There are three main types of brainstroming: ideational, non-ideational, and scientific. Ideational brainstroming is the most common type of brainstroming. It occurs when an individual has an idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. Non-ideational brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea but can't seem to put it into words. Scientific brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. It usually happens when an individual is working on a project and they have no other ideas.
