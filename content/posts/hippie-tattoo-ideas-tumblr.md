The Future of Housing: How will technology change housing and homelessness?
Technology is already changing many aspects of our everyday lives, from how we shop to how we cook. It could soon change the way we live and work too, with implications for housing and homelessness. This article will explore some of the possibilities. 
One idea is that technology could help to create more affordable housing by providing a more accurate representation of what people actually need and want in their homes. Another possibility is that it could help individuals or groups who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to find new homes, either through advertizing or directly working with landlords. 

All of these ideas are just starting to be considered, and there are still many questions remaining about how they will be implemented. However, if done correctly, these changes could have positive impacts on both individuals and groups who need housing but don't currently have it.

What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:
1) Making cars into machines. This is a really bad idea because it will make the cars more efficient and faster, but it will also make them more expensive to maintain.
2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.
3) Creating welfare programs that only benefit the wealthy. This would be a really bad idea because it would create a lot of competition among businesses and it would drive up prices for goods and services.
4) making school harder than necessary.
