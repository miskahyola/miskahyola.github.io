Types of creative art: There are three main types of creative art: painting, sculpture, and television.
Creative art is anything that leads to new ideas, whether it’s creating new products, learning about new cultures, or just making something yourself. There are three main types of creative art: painting, sculpture, and television. Here are eight examples of creative art that can be used in your own artwork or projects: 
1. Sculpture: sculptures can be used to represent different concepts or objects in a realistic way. For example, the Statue of Liberty could be represented by a beautiful model with details and textures that represent the statue’s iconic design. 
2. Painting: paintings can be used to capture moments or emotions in a candid way. For example, if you were painting a portrait of someone you know, you might use colorful and lively scenes to show how the person looks before and after their experience with creativity.
