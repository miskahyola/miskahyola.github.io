The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.

What are some invention ideas?
1. Invention ideas are always in flux, and since new technologies keep popping up, it’s hard to come up with anything that’s truly original. However, there are a few things that you can try and base your inventions off of. One idea is to take an old technology and make it more user-friendly. Another idea is to come up with a new way of doing something that has been done before but not in the same way. Finally, you can simply come up with an idea that you have never thought of before and see if anyone else has had the same idea.
