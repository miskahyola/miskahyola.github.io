How do you come up with good ideas?
Ideas are a dime a dozen, but they often have the potential to be great. Here are three tips to come up with good ideas:
1. Take your time – don’t just give up on an idea right away. Start by thinking about it more closely and then coming up with potential ways that it could be improved.

2. Be open to feedback – If you don’t think your idea is good, ask other people for their opinions. This will help you get closer to the best version of your idea.

3. Be persistent – If you keep working on your idea, eventually it will become better.

If you're like most people, you probably have a basic understanding of how a watch works and what it looks like. But if you're looking for tips on how to build your own watch, there's still a lot you don't know.  So, in this article, we'll take a look at how to make a simple wristwatch using only materials you likely have at home. 
So first off, all you need is some leather or plastic wrap and some screws. You'll also need an electric drill and some wood screws. Next, take the leather or plastic wrap and cut it into 1" pieces. Once the pieces are cut, use the electric drill to start drilling into the top of each piece. Make sure that each hole is as close to the other as possible so that your finished product will be properly assembled.
