Whatever the process, creativity is often required for the creation of beautiful and unique works of art.

Idea 3: We need to be more open about our values
The world is constantly changing, and so too are the ways that people value and hold onto certain values. In order to stay ahead of the curve, we need to be more open about our own values.
One way to do this is by sharing our thoughts with others. Another way is by writing down what we believe and why it matters to us. Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with someone who understands our values in order for us to start writing them down ourselves.

Ultimately, we need to be more conscious about how we value the things that matter most to us in order to stay ahead of the curve and stay true to our own values.

Conclusion: How can creativity help you achieve success and stay creative?
Creativity can help you achieve success and stay creative. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Find an outlet for your creativity. When you have something to explore, creativity will flow freely. So find something that interests you and start writing or drawing inspiration from it. 
2. Connect with others like yourself. There is no secret to success if you want it - reach out to people who share your same interests and passions in order to get their ideas flowing. If all else fails, talking about your ideas with a friend or family member can be very helpful in inspiring new thoughts and ideas. 
3. Take the time to practice often. Practice makes perfect - so practice what you love most, no matter how difficult it may be to do so regularly (and don't forget- sometimes practice makes perfect).
