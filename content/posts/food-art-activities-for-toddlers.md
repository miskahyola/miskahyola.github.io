Category: Creative Ideas
Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.
