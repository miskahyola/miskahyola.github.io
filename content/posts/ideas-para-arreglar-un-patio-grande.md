History of invention: How has innovation been used throughout history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to create something. This includes both the simple things like making tools or buildings, and more complex items like air travel or computers. Inventions have had a direct impact on the way we live and work, as well as the way society functions. 
Here are three examples of some of the most famous inventions in human history: 

1) The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, which allowed for the spread of literacy and knowledge across cultures. 
2) The Concorde class jet airliner was developed by British Airways in 1969, which made air travel much more affordable and practical.

Are there any dangers associated with coming up with new ideas?
Ideas can be a great way to get people thinking, but there are always some dangers associated with them. One danger is that people may not take the time to think through the implications of the idea before they come up with it. Another danger is that people may not be able to see the potential for the idea to work, and may instead just create something without any real thought or planning. Finally, ideas can also be dangerous if not properly executed. If someone comes up with an idea that does not have a lot of potential or if it does not involve anything original, then it can lead to a lot of problems.
