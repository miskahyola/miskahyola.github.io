The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.
