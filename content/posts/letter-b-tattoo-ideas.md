The process is simple: take a few minutes to come up with as many ideas as possible, and then let them sit for a few moments. After that, you can start brainstorming by focusing on one idea and trying to come up with more ideas about it.

Great ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with new ones. Here are some tips to get you started:

2. Be open to new possibilities. Don’t be afraid to try something different or explore what might be out of your comfort zone. This will give you a wealth of ideas to consider when crafting new TMNT concepts and storylines. 
3. Take your time.

The four types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory.
Creative art is something that helps to express yourself and your thoughts. There are four different types of creativity which can be expressed through visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory means. Each type of creative expression has its own strengths and weaknesses. Visual creativity is often seen as the most direct form of creative expression. This type of creativity is often used to create artworks that are representational or specific to a certain era or culture.Auditory creativity is often used when artists need to connect with their audience in order to express their ideas. This type of creativity can be used for music, sound design, and audio production. Kinesthetic creativity is often used when artists need to explore new ways to experience the world around them. This type of creativity can be used for sculptures, dance, and performance art.
