The Power of Big Ideas
The power of big ideas is at the root of most innovation. Ideas that are large enough to engage people and make a difference can touch every aspect of our lives. From the simplest things to the biggest challenges, big ideas can impact everything and everyone around them.
There are a number of ways to create big ideas, but some are easier than others. One approach is to come up with a concept that you’re passionate about and then explore what others have said about it. Another way is to read articles, watch videos, or listen to lectures on different topics in order to develop an idea for your business or product.

Whatever method you choose, remember that big ideas are worth pursuing – no matter how challenging or difficult they may seem at first.

Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
Big ideas are those that have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. There are many big ideas out there, but it can be tough to find the right one to bring about big results. Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

2. A new payment method that allows anyone with an internet connection and a phone or tablet device to easily pay for goods and services using their phones or tablets.
