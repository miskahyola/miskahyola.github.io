diy upgrades for your kitchen island
If you're looking to spruce up your kitchen island with some modern updates, there are a few easy ways to do it. Here are some ideas for upgrades that can make your kitchen island more functional and inviting: 
1. Add a new sink or faucet - This will add functionality and water flow to your kitchen area, as well as adding an extra touch of modernity. Plus, many sinks these days come with built-in drains for easy cleaning. 
2. Add an oven - Ovens are another great addition to the kitchen island equation. They can provide heat and cooking space, as well as offer a sleek look. Be sure to choose one that is properly sized and has an automatic timer so you don't have to keep track of time in the kitchen.
