Early Inventors and Inventions
Invention is a process of putting new ideas or objects into use. Inventions are often born out of necessity, as people try to solve everyday problems. But some inventions are created simply for the sake of novelty or fun. Early inventors made many important contributions to society, developing useful technologies that we still use today.
Some of the earliest known inventors include the Ancient Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria, who created the first steam engine, and Ctesibius, who invented the first water pump. In China, inventors developed paper and gunpowder in the 9th century. These inventions would have a profound impact on the world.

The Industrial Revolution saw a wave of new inventions that changed the way we live and work. Among these were the spinning jenny, which revolutionized textile production, and the steam engine, which powered factories and transportation.
