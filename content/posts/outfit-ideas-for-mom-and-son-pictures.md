Conclusion: Why is invention so important?
Invention has been a vital part of human history and economy for centuries. It allows people to create new products and services that they can sell and improve their lives. Inventions have also helped keep our society running smoothly, as well as protecting the environment.
So why is invention so important? There are many reasons, but one of the most important is that it helps us solve problems. Inventions allow us to make things that we wouldn’t be able to make on our own, or design things that we would never have thought possible.

Brainstroming is a technique used in business to improve decision making. The brainstem is the part of the brain that controls heart rate, breathing, and other basic bodily functions. When a business owner uses brainstroming, they can better understand their customer’s needs and determine what changes need to be made to meet those needs. This allows businesses to make informed decisions, which in turn leads to increased profits.
