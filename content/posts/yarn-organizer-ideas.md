One of the great things about being a creativity seeker is that you have all sorts of ways to get your ideas off the ground. You can brainstorm, come up with new concepts, or simply think outside the box. Here are a few tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1) Talk with other people: When you’re brainstorming, it can be helpful to talk with others. This will help you share your thoughts and get feedback. It can also help you create a group consensus on what should be done next.
