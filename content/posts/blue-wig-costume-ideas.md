Invention as a process: How does an inventor create a new product or idea?
Invention can be defined as the process of creating a new product or idea. Inventions result from the combined efforts of an inventor and their team. The team may include scientists, engineers, and designers. The goal of the team is to come up with a solution that meets the needs of the customer or user.
Invention is often a difficult process because it involves many steps and requires a lot of creativity. In order to create a successful invention, the inventor must have a clear idea of what they want to achieve and how they plan on achieving it. Without these plans, it is difficult to create a product that meets the needs of users.
