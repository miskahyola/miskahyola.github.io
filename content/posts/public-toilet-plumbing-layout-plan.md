brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.

Different types of innovation:
Innovation is a key term in business. It can be defined as the process of making something new and better. There are many types of innovation, some of which are more common than others. 
One type of innovation is product innovation. This refers to the development of a new product that does not already exist. In this case, the company must come up with a new way to make their product and market it to customers. 

Another type of innovation is process innovation. This occurs when companies improve the way they do something, such as developing a new manufacturing process or changing how they distribute products. Process innovations can have a big impact on the efficiency and profitability of businesses.
