In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals?
Creative goals can be anything from making a beautiful piece of art to designing a new product. There are several things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should always aim for the best possible outcome. If you do not care about the end result, then your creativity will likely not be productive. Another important thing to consider when trying to achieve creative goals is how you plan on achieving them. Do not try to accomplish too many things at once, as this will likely lead to frustration and further planning problems. Lastly, do not forget that creativity does not have to come from inside yourself â€“ it can also come from outside sources. When looking for inspiration, look for stories or articles that might help jog your memory and create new ideas.
