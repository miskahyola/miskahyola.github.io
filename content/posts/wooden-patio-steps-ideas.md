Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are better than those currently available. It can be defined in many ways, but one way to think of it is as the change in direction of a product or service over time. Innovation can come from a company owner who decides to bring a new idea to market, as well as from employees who come up with new ways to do things that improve productivity or customer satisfaction.
