Future of work: What ways will technology impact the way we work?
Technology is constantly evolving, so the future of work is always in question. Some ideas that could impact the way we work include:1) Virtual assistant technology – This could eventually allow people to work remotely and then receive help when they need it.2) Augmented reality – This could be used to improve efficiency by giving employees more information at a glance.3) Artificial intelligence – This is being developed to help with tasks that are too difficult or time-consuming for humans to do.4) Robot assistants – These can be used for tasks that are too dangerous or time- consuming for humans to do, such as cleaning or laundry.5) Driverless cars – These cars don’t have drivers, so employees would no longer have to worry about getting lost in the traffic.6) Collaborative working environment – This would involve employees working together towards a common goal instead of individually.

The educational process of creativity: How does it happen?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts, is an important part of any successful artist. However, the process of creativity can vary depending on how someone is educated. Some people learn how to be creative through art classes or Leroy Sizemore’s The Creative Process. Others learn it through reading or watching creative minds work. Regardless of how someone learns to be creative, the end goal is the same-to come up with new ideas and concepts that can help them in their artwork and business endeavors.
