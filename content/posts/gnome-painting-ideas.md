Creative ideas abound when it comes to art and design. From something as simple as a new piece of jewelry to an elaborate design for a home, there are endless possibilities when it comes to both. Here are a few ideas that photographer and creative writer Damon Knight has come up with himself:
1. A series of prints of artwork made from recycled materials. This could be turned into an exhibit or displayed in a public space to inspire others to think about how they can make their own slice of the world by recycling.
2. A set of kinetic sculptures that react based on the movements of the viewer. This could be used as part of a public installation or display in a museum.3. A mixed media piece inspired by nature that is both beautiful and functional.

The impact of inventions: What people and businesses are doing with invented products now
Invention is a word that has been used for centuries to describe creativity and innovation. Today, it is used more specifically to describe the process of creating something new. Inventions can be from small ideas to revolutionary products. The impact of inventions on businesses and people is often difficult to measure, but there are a number of ways in which they can have an impact. 
One way in which inventions can have a significant impact on businesses is by providing new ways to make money. Businesses that use invented products more often find that they can make more money and do better with their products because they now have a solution that was not possible before. Additionally, businesses can find that they need to change their marketing strategy if they hope to catch up with those who have been using invented products for years. 

People also play a role in the impact of inventions.
